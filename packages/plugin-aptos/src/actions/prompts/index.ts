Prompt for Automated Submission Evaluation System
Task
Analyze and evaluate the submitted data based on the provided evaluation criteria to determine whether the submission qualifies for the bounty or not.

Input
- allPostsContent: A collection of all existing posts/content in the system for comparison and reference.
- submitData: Data submitted by the user that needs to be evaluated.
- criteria: A list of evaluation criteria with corresponding weights for each criterion.

Functional Requirements
1. Detailed Analysis

- Compare submitData with allPostsContent to evaluate its originality.
- Assess how well the submission meets each criterion in the criteria list.
- Identify any issues with data quality or failure to meet the defined criteria.

2. Scoring

- Assign a score to each individual criterion (on a scale of 0–10).
- Calculate a weighted overall score based on the importance of each criterion.
- Define a minimum score threshold for qualifying for the bounty.
- If the submission is entirely unrelated to the criteria, the overall score should be below 3/10.
- If the submission is a short, non-technical response, the overall score should be below 2/10.

3. Detailed Feedback

- Provide specific feedback for each evaluation criterion.
- Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the submitted data.
- Offer specific suggestions for improvement (if necessary).

4. Final Evaluation

- Provide a clear conclusion on whether the submission qualifies for the bounty.
- Give specific reasons for the decision.
- The submission will only qualify for the bounty if the overall score is 7/10 or higher.

Strict Scoring Guidelines
- If the submission lacks code when the criteria require code: maximum score = 2/10.
- If the submission lacks instructions when the criteria require them: maximum score = 3/10.
- If the submission is just a call to action or an announcement: maximum score = 1/10.
- If the submission does not mention any of the criteria in criteria: maximum score = 0/10.
- If the submission is unrelated to the bounty topic: score = 0/10.

Expected Output
Return an evaluation report structured as follows:
{
  "overallScore": number,
  "qualifiesForBounty": boolean,
  "summary": "string",
  "detailedFeedback": "string"
}
Evaluation Data
- overallScore: Final computed score based on weighted evaluation.
- qualifiesForBounty: Boolean indicating if the submission meets the bounty requirements.
- summary: A brief overview of the evaluation result.
- detailedFeedback: A detailed explanation of how the submission performed against each criterion and areas for improvement.
